# Landing-Page

You can find the deployed project at [Landing-Page](http://landing-page.shanejeremich.vercel.app/)

## Overview

This was a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN/hub/easybank-landing-page-6jVtpaX8Q). The challenge is to test my skills to replicate this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible that is provided to me.

> **The Challenge**

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript required is for the mobile navigation toggle. However, you could also try doing this without JS.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
